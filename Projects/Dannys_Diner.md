## Problem Statement
Danny’s Diner is in need of our assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business. He wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. 

## Outcome
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.


## Data Sets
Danny has provided us with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues and hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions - spoiler alert, they are!

Danny has provieded us with 3 datasets:
<details>
<summary><h3>Sales</h3></summary>
The sales table captures all <b><code>customer_id</code></b> level purchases with an corresponding <b><code>order_date</code></b> and <b><code>product_id</code></b> information for when and what menu items were ordered.
